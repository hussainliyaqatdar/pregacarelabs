// Generates 5 SEO-oriented FAQs for a test or package product page, covering
// the search intents the business asked for: "<name> near me", "<name> price
// in Bangalore", "<name> home collection", "<name> meaning", and "<name> at
// NABL accredited labs". Answers are built from real, already-vetted facts on
// the item (price, eta, description) plus the site's actual service area and
// lab partnership - nothing about a specific test/package is invented here.
//
// Scope: every package gets FAQs; for individual tests, only the ones the
// business named (the 65 tests in the CC SPRF price list) do, so this doesn't
// silently spam 593 near-duplicate FAQ blocks across the whole catalog.

// Test codes from the business's CC SPRF price list (Agilus catalog codes,
// matched 1:1 against data/tests.json's own `code` field - see the session
// notes for how these were extracted). Matching by code rather than by slug
// so this keeps working even if a test's slug or friendly name changes later.
