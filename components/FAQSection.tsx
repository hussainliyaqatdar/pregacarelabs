  {
    q: "Can I get an NIPT test done at home in Bangalore?",
    a: `Yes. NIPT (Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing) is available for home collection anywhere we cover in Bangalore - our phlebotomist visits you, so there's no need to search for "NIPT test near me" and travel to a lab. Results are shared via WhatsApp once ready.`,

  },
  {
    q: "Is a pregnancy blood test at home as reliable as visiting a lab?",
    a: `Yes. Every sample we collect at home is processed in the same NABL-accredited labs (Agilus Diagnostics, formerly SRL) that walk-in patients use - the only difference is convenience. This applies to routine pregnancy blood tests as well as specialised ones like NIPT.`,
